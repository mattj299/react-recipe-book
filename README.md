## Built using React

I built this project using create-react-app and an api: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

## Project use

You can use this project to save recipes that you created or you can get brand new recipes from the api used

This api has a variety of choices and you get these choices by either searching up the name or clicking
a button which randomly generates a recipe for you that is on the api

## How to start

Clone the repository, install all necessities in order to run react on your local machine, and run it.
You start off with 3 randomly generated recipes called from the api then from there you can add, search, remove, or even get random recipes from the api

## Why this was built

This project was built when I was learning react and it's to test out what I learned from react and fetching
